    """segment_csr reduces all entries of a CSR-formatted
    matrix by summing or averaging over neighbors.

    Used to reduce features over neighborhoods
    in neuralop.layers.IntegralTransform

    If use_scatter is set to False or torch_scatter is not
    properly built, segment_csr falls back to a naive PyTorch implementation

    Note: the native version is mainly intended for running tests on 
    CPU-only GitHub CI runners to get around a versioning issue. 
    torch_scatter should be installed and built if possible. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    src : torch.Tensor
        tensor of features for each point
    indptr : torch.Tensor
        splits representing start and end indices
        of each neighborhood in src
    reduce : Literal['mean', 'sum']
        how to reduce a neighborhood. if mean,
        reduce by taking the average of all neighbors.
        Otherwise take the sum.
